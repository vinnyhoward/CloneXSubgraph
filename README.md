The Clone X collection, a collaboration between RTFKT and Takashi Murakami, features 20,000 next-gen Avatars. This ambitious project marks the beginning of a comprehensive ecosystem designed for our community. Focused on quality and sophistication, these high-end avatars are meticulously crafted, ready to make their mark in the metaverse.

## Queries
A list of complete example queries you can make can be found here: [Queries.md](Queries.md) 

List of queries that are done or currently under the works

### Finished Queries
✅ Query transactions of the last 30 days 

✅ Query transactions within a specific time frame

✅ Query account data by wallet address

✅ Query current owner and transactions by token id

### Failed to create these queries (will try again later)
❌ Query token metadata (Having issues with assemblyscript parsing my trait data. I assume it is because it is too large. May use a backend just to store and fetch traits by token id)

❌ Query sales for the last 30 days (having issues finding the right contract to find sales. Seems like they are all proxy contracts and there is a lot of them so it is impossible to find them all)
